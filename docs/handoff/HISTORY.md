## 2026-04-26 — M14.2 APPROVED, archiving handoff

# Current Handoff

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: M14.2 — Apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout
- **Milestone**: M14 — Feature Dependencies / DAG (Tranche D, v0.6.0)
- **Status**: Review — ready for code-review sub-agent (implementation complete 2026-04-26)
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-26

## Session Summary

M14.2 implemented in three coordinated layers:

1. **Recipe schema** — added `CreatedBy string` (json:`created_by,omitempty`) to `workflow.RecipeOperation`. Field is persisted but inert; `omitempty` preserves byte-identity for v0.5.3 recipes.
2. **6-skill parity-guard rollout** — documented `created_by` in all 6 shipped skill formats + `docs/agent-as-provider.md`. Parity guard re-run after each file; stayed green throughout.
3. **Apply gate** — new `workflow.CheckDependencyGate(s, slug)` enforces ADR-011 D4. No-op when `Config.DAGEnabled()` is false; otherwise rejects hard parents not in `applied`/`upstream_merged` (with `satisfied_by` SHA-shape check, no reachability — documented limitation per ADR-011 D5). Wired at the top of `runApplyAuto` and inside `runApplyExecute` (defence-in-depth). Soft deps never block. Sentinel `ErrParentNotApplied`, wrappable via `errors.Is`.

## Files Changed

- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — added `CreatedBy` field on `RecipeOperation`
- `internal/workflow/dependency_gate.go` — new file, `CheckDependencyGate` + `ErrParentNotApplied`
- `internal/workflow/dependency_gate_test.go` — 9 unit tests (all 8 task-required scenarios + bad-SHA bonus)
- `internal/workflow/recipe_createdby_test.go` — 3 round-trip / schema-closure tests
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — gate wired into `runApplyExecute` + `runApplyAuto`
- `internal/cli/dependency_gate_apply_test.go` — CLI integration tests (blocked + bypass-when-flag-off)
- `assets/skills/claude/tessera-patch/SKILL.md` — `created_by` documentation
- `assets/skills/copilot/tessera-patch/SKILL.md` — `created_by` documentation
- `assets/skills/cursor/tessera-patch.mdc` — `created_by` documentation
- `assets/skills/windsurf/windsurfrules` — `created_by` documentation
- `assets/workflows/tessera-patch-generic.md` — `created_by` documentation
- `assets/prompts/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md` — `created_by` documentation
- `docs/agent-as-provider.md` — canonical `created_by` documentation
- `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` — status updates (this file)

## Test Results

```
gofmt -l .                        # clean
go build ./cmd/tpatch             # ok
go test ./...                     # all green (assets, cli, gitutil, provider, safety, store, workflow)
go test ./internal/workflow -run 'DependencyGate|Recipe|CreatedBy' -count=1  # 12 PASS
go test ./internal/store    -run 'DAG|Dependency|Validate|Roundtrip' -count=1  # 17 PASS (M14.1 regression clean)
go test ./assets/...              # parity guard PASS
```

## Deferred / Documented Limitations

- `satisfied_by` reachability (`git merge-base`) is intentionally NOT checked in M14.2. The gate verifies only that the value is a 40-hex SHA; ADR-011 D5 treats `satisfied_by` as provenance, not a runtime guard. Logged here so M14.3+ can choose to add a reachability check if a real consumer materialises.
- `created_by` is not yet emitted by the implement phase — wiring deferred to M14.3 alongside the label-composition consumer.
- `--mode prepare` and `--mode started` are deliberately NOT gated. They write only `.tpatch/` artifacts and do not mutate the working tree; ADR-011 D4 scopes the gate to recipe execution.

## Context for Reviewer

- Reviewer guard remained dormant in M14.2 (no reconcile changes). Search `dependency_gate.go` for the `status.Reconcile.Outcome` rule comment — it's documented in the doc-comment so M14.3 inherits the constraint.
- Soft deps are not surfaced in the error message at all. M14.3 may want to surface soft-dep ordering hints separately; out of scope here.
- The CLI integration test seeds the recipe by hand under `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/` — same pattern as `TestApplyAutoMode`.


### Context

M14.1 landed the data model: `Dependency` struct + `FeatureStatus.DependsOn` (omitempty) + DFS cycle detection + Kahn topo + 5 validation rules + sentinel errors + `features_dependencies` flag (default false). 30 new tests, byte-identity round-trip guard, no callers yet gate on the flag.

M14.2 adds the **first behavior change** — but still gated. With `features_dependencies=true`:
1. `tpatch apply` refuses to execute when any **hard** parent is not yet `applied`/`upstream_merged`.
2. The recipe gains a new optional op `created_by` so child features can declare which parent originated a file (used by M14.3 for label composition).

### Authoritative docs (must read before coding)

1. `docs/adrs/ADR-011-feature-dependencies.md` — locks 9 decisions. Especially **D4** (hard deps gate apply + `created_by`; soft gates neither) and **D5** (`upstream_merged` satisfies deps via `satisfied_by`).
2. `docs/prds/PRD-feature-dependencies.md` — §3.2 apply gate semantics, §3.3 validation, §3.5 labels (READ but DON'T IMPLEMENT — that's M14.3), §6 milestone sizing.
3. `docs/adrs/ADR-010-provider-conflict-resolver.md` D5 — artifact ownership contract. Note: M14.2 does NOT touch reconcile, so this is reference-only.
4. `assets/assets_test.go` — the parity guard. M14.2 mutates the recipe JSON contract — the parity guard MUST stay green after the rollout.

### M14.2 scope (~250 LOC + 6 skill format updates)

#### 1. Apply gate (~80 LOC)

- New: `workflow.CheckDependencyGate(s *Store, slug string) error` — looks up the feature's `DependsOn`, for each `Kind=hard` parent verifies `state ∈ {applied, upstream_merged}` (and if `upstream_merged`, that `SatisfiedBy` matches a parent commit reachable from current HEAD — minimal check, see PRD §3.2).
- Wire into `apply --mode execute` and `apply --mode auto` BEFORE the existing recipe execution begins. Soft deps are NOT gated — they're ordering hints only.
- **Gated by `features_dependencies` flag** — when false, `CheckDependencyGate` is a no-op. Same flag from M14.1.
- Error message must be actionable: list the blocking parent slug(s) and their current state. Suggest `tpatch apply <parent>` first.
- Sentinel: `ErrParentNotApplied` (wrappable via `errors.Is`).

Tests:
- gate-disabled-passes (flag off, hard parent in `analyzed` state — apply proceeds)
- gate-rejects-hard-unapplied (flag on, hard parent in `analyzed` — apply rejected)
- gate-allows-hard-applied (flag on, hard parent applied — apply proceeds)
- gate-allows-upstream-merged (flag on, hard parent in `upstream_merged` with valid `satisfied_by` — apply proceeds)
- gate-rejects-upstream-merged-bad-sha (flag on, `satisfied_by` not reachable from HEAD — apply rejected)
- gate-ignores-soft (flag on, only soft parents unapplied — apply proceeds)
- gate-mixed (flag on, one hard applied + one hard not + one soft not — apply rejected with only the unapplied hard listed)

#### 2. `created_by` recipe op (~120 LOC + 6-skill rollout)

PRD §3.4 (NOTE: this section has the residual ADR-011 D6 terminology drift — defer to ADR-011 D4 + §3.5 for any conflict). The recipe gains an optional field on each operation:

```json
{
  "op": "patch",
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "created_by": "feat-jwt-auth",   // optional; the parent slug that originated this file
  "content": "..."
}
```

- Update `internal/workflow/recipe.go` (or wherever `RecipeOperation` is defined) to add `CreatedBy string \`json:"created_by,omitempty"\`` field.
- The field is **persisted but inert in M14.2** — no behavior depends on it. M14.3 reads it for label composition. Document this clearly in a doc comment.
- `omitempty` is critical — recipes generated for features with no DAG flag must round-trip byte-identical to v0.5.3.
- Add a positive recipe-parsing test that round-trips a recipe with `created_by` set; add a negative test confirming an unknown field still fails the parity guard's `DisallowUnknownFields` (the schema is closed except for known fields).

#### 3. 6-skill parity-guard rollout — COORDINATED ATOMIC CHANGE

The parity guard (`assets/assets_test.go`) enforces that the recipe schema documented in skill files matches the Go struct. Every skill format must be updated **in lockstep** with the Go struct change:

- `assets/skills/claude/tessera-patch/SKILL.md`
- `assets/skills/copilot/tessera-patch/SKILL.md`
- `assets/skills/cursor/tessera-patch.mdc`
- `assets/skills/windsurf/windsurfrules`
- `assets/workflows/tessera-patch-generic.md`
- `assets/prompts/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md`

Plus `docs/agent-as-provider.md` (the canonical contract reference).

In each, document the `created_by` field as: optional, parent feature slug, ordering/label hint only, currently inert.

Run `go test ./assets/...` after each skill is updated to catch drift early.

#### 4. Strict scope guards

DO NOT in M14.2:
- Compose DAG labels or add the `blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution` compound verdict (M14.3)
- Touch reconcile topological traversal (M14.3)
- Add `tpatch status --dag` output (M14.4)
- Bump version, update CHANGELOG, or tag (M14.4 supervisor task at v0.6.0)
- Add new external Go dependencies

### External reviewer guard (still applies)

Any new logic must read `status.Reconcile.Outcome` for reconcile-result decisions, NEVER `artifacts/reconcile-session.json`. M14.2 doesn't touch reconcile, but `created_by` is read by M14.3's label composition — do NOT introduce any convenience that reads the session artifact in M14.2 prep.

### Validation gate

```
gofmt -l .
go build ./cmd/tpatch
go test ./...
go test ./assets/...   # parity guard
go test ./internal/workflow -run 'DependencyGate|CreatedBy|Recipe' -count=1 -v
```

### Workflow

1. Update CURRENT.md "Status: In Progress".
2. Read ADR-011 (D4, D5 especially), PRD §3.2, §3.4, parity guard test.
3. Add the recipe field + write the parity-guard-respecting tests FIRST. Run `go test ./assets/...`. (Get the parity guard green BEFORE adding the gate.)
4. Update the 6 skill formats in lockstep with the Go struct.
5. Implement `CheckDependencyGate` + tests. Wire into apply.
6. Run full validation gate.
7. 2-3 logical commits, all with the `Co-authored-by` trailer.
8. Push to `origin/main`.
9. Final CURRENT.md update flagging "ready for code-review sub-agent".

### Out-of-band reminder for the implementer

The repo's tpatch binary at root is NOT gitignored. After `go build ./cmd/tpatch`, delete the binary or build into `/bin/`. Don't commit it.

### Deferred behind M14.2

- M14.3 — Reconcile topo + composable labels + compound verdict (~500 LOC)
- M14.4 — `status --dag` + skills analyze-phase bullet + `docs/dependencies.md` + tag v0.6.0 (~300 LOC)

### Registered follow-ups (unchanged)

- `feat-ephemeral-mode` — depends on `feat-feature-import` + `feat-delivery-modes`
- `feat-feature-reorder` — depends on `feat-feature-dependencies` (i.e., M14)
- `feat-resolver-dag-context`, `feat-feature-autorebase`, `feat-amend-dependent-warning`
- `feat-skills-apply-auto-default`, `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown`, `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary`

## 2026-04-26 — M14.1 APPROVED, archiving handoff

# Current Handoff

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: M14.1 — Feature Dependencies data model + validation
- **Milestone**: M14 — Feature Dependencies / DAG (Tranche D, v0.6.0)
- **Status**: Review (ready for code-review sub-agent, completed 2026-04-24)
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-24

### Session Summary (2026-04-24)

Implemented the M14.1 data-model + validation slice, fully gated behind `features_dependencies` (default false). No user-visible behaviour change. All 5 PRD §3.3 validation rules covered with sentinel errors + tests; DFS cycle detection and Kahn topological order pure functions in `internal/store/dag.go`; round-trip byte-identity verified against a pre-M14 `status.json` fixture.

### Files Changed

- `internal/store/types.go` — added `Dependency` struct, kind constants, `DependsOn []Dependency` (omitempty) on `FeatureStatus`, `FeaturesDependencies bool` config field, `Config.DAGEnabled()` helper.
- `internal/store/dag.go` (new) — `DetectCycles`, `TopologicalOrder` (Kahn, deterministic), `Children`, `ErrCycle` sentinel. Pure, no IO. Doc comments enforce the ADR-010 D5 reminder for downstream readers.
- `internal/store/validation.go` (new) — `ValidateDependencies` + `ValidateAllFeatures`; sentinels `ErrSelfDependency`, `ErrDanglingDependency`, `ErrKindConflict`, `ErrSatisfiedByRequiresUpstream`, `ErrInvalidDependencyKind`.
- `internal/store/store.go` — repo `SaveConfig`/`parseYAMLConfig` now round-trip the flat `features_dependencies:` key.
- `internal/store/global.go` — global `renderGlobalYAML` and `mergeConfig` carry the same key (repo-true OR'd into global).
- `internal/store/dag_test.go` (new) — empty graph, isolated node, self-edge, 2-/3-node cycles, linear acyclic, diamond, deterministic topo (50 iters), Kahn cycle error path, `Children` ordering.
- `internal/store/validation_test.go` (new) — positive + negative cases for all 5 rules, plus `ValidateAllFeatures` surfacing all sentinels at once.
- `internal/store/roundtrip_test.go` (new) — pre-M14 fixture byte-identity, empty `depends_on` omit guard, populated `depends_on` round-trip, `Config.FeaturesDependencies` round-trip.
- `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` — this update.

### Test Results

- `gofmt -l .` → clean
- `go build ./cmd/tpatch` → ok
- `go test ./...` → all packages pass (store 1.6s, cli 5.1s, workflow 12.2s).
- Targeted: `go test ./internal/store -run 'DAG|Cycle|Topo|Children|Validate|Roundtrip|Config_Features' -count=1 -v` → 30 cases, all PASS.

### Implementation choices (M14.1)

- **Config flag shape**: Option A (flat top-level key `features_dependencies: true|false`). Lower risk; works with existing flat YAML parser (`internal/store/store.go:497`). Nested `features:` block deferred — would force a parser rewrite for no semantic gain.
- **Flag wiring scope**: Flag parses + round-trips. No callers gate on it in M14.1 — apply/reconcile wiring lives in M14.2/M14.3.
- **Doc-comment guard**: `Dependency` and DAG types carry an explicit comment that `status.Reconcile.Outcome` is the authoritative reconcile result; `reconcile-session.json` is audit-only (per ADR-010 D5).

### Context

v0.5.3 shipped (`4636878`, `3ac7465`, `8a4af4b`, `6024942`, tag `v0.5.3`). All correctness baselines needed for M14 now in place:

- `workflow.AcceptShadow` is the single accept helper for shadow → real (v0.5.2) and stamps `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied` (v0.5.3) — M14.3 label composition will read it.
- Resolver and reconcile have clean artifact ownership: `resolution-session.json` (per-file outcomes) vs `reconcile-session.json` (high-level summary).
- Recipe stale guard catches both HEAD and content drift.
- Index-dirty bug on refresh fixed.

No shipped feature currently exposes `depends_on` — M14.1 adds the data model behind `features.dependencies: true` config flag (default false).

### Authoritative docs (read before coding)

1. `docs/adrs/ADR-011-feature-dependencies.md` — **MUST READ**. Locks 9 decisions.
2. `docs/prds/PRD-feature-dependencies.md` — 736-line PRD (APPROVED WITH NOTES). §3.1 data model, §3.5 composable labels, §4.5 precedence, §6 milestone sizing, §7 acceptance criteria. Note §3.4 residual terminology drift — **always defer to ADR-011 + §4.5** when the two conflict.
3. `docs/ROADMAP.md` M14 section — sub-milestone boundaries.

### M14.1 scope (~300 LOC)

**Code additions**:
- `internal/store/types.go`: `Dependency` struct (`slug`, `kind` = `hard|soft`, optional `satisfied_by` for `upstream_merged`) added to `FeatureStatus` as `depends_on []Dependency`.
- `internal/store/dag.go` (new): DFS cycle detection + Kahn topological traversal over the feature set. Pure functions; no IO.
- `internal/store/validation.go` (new): 5 validation rules per PRD §3.3:
  1. No self-dependency.
  2. No cycles.
  3. No dangling refs (every `slug` must exist in the store).
  4. No kind conflict (same parent declared both hard and soft is rejected).
  5. `satisfied_by` only valid when parent state is `upstream_merged`.
- `internal/store/config.go` (or wherever config lives): `features.dependencies` bool flag, default false. All DAG code paths must no-op when flag is off.
- CLI plumbing: no user-visible commands in M14.1. Just make `add`/`status` round-trip the new field when the flag is on.

**Tests**:
- `dag_test.go`: cycle detection (direct self, 2-node, 3-node), topo order determinism (ties broken by slug), empty graph, single node.
- `validation_test.go`: each of 5 rules with positive and negative cases.
- Round-trip: add a feature with `depends_on`, reload from disk, verify equality.
- Feature-flag off: all new code paths bypassed; `status.json` schema unchanged byte-for-byte for pre-M14.1 fixtures.

**Not in M14.1** (belongs to M14.2+):
- Apply gate enforcement.
- `created_by` recipe op.
- Reconcile topological traversal.
- Composable DAG labels.
- `status --dag` output.
- Any of the 6 skill-format updates.

### Suggested approach

1. Read ADR-011 end to end, then PRD §3 and §4.5.
2. Sketch the `Dependency` struct + `FeatureStatus` additions.
3. Write `dag.go` + tests first (pure, fast iteration).
4. Write `validation.go` + tests.
5. Wire the config flag; ensure zero behavior change when flag is off.
6. Round-trip test from existing `status.json` fixtures to prove backward compat.

### Validation required

- `gofmt -l .` clean
- `go build ./cmd/tpatch`
- `go test ./...`

### Guardrails

- No scope creep into M14.2/.3/.4.
- No changes to the recipe JSON schema (that's M14.2 — gated by the parity guard).
- No new external Go dependencies.
- All commits must carry the `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer.

### Deferred behind M14.1

- M14.2 — Apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout (~250 LOC)
- M14.3 — Reconcile topological traversal + composable labels + compound verdict (~500 LOC)
- M14.4 — `status --dag`, skills analyze-phase bullet, `docs/dependencies.md`, tag v0.6.0 (~300 LOC)

### Registered follow-ups (unchanged from C3)

- `feat-ephemeral-mode` — depends on `feat-feature-import` + `feat-delivery-modes`
- `feat-feature-reorder` — depends on `feat-feature-dependencies` (i.e., M14)
- `feat-resolver-dag-context`, `feat-feature-autorebase`, `feat-amend-dependent-warning`
- `feat-skills-apply-auto-default`, `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown`, `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary`

## 2026-04-24 — Tranche C3 / v0.5.3 shipped

# Current Handoff

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: Tranche C3 / v0.5.3 — shadow accept accounting fixes (✅ **3/3 items landed on main; release task is supervisor's**)
- **Status**: ✅ Implementation + regression test landed on `origin/main`. Tag + CHANGELOG + version bump deferred to supervisor (per agent guardrails).
- **Blocks**: M14.1 — M14.3 reads `status.Reconcile.Outcome` for ADR-011 D6 label composition. C3 clears the baseline.
- **Previous**: Tranche C2 / v0.5.2 shipped ✅ — archived in `HISTORY.md`

### C3 scope — external reviewer surfaced 3 follow-ups on v0.5.2 shadow flow

All verified by code inspection:

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| c3-separate-resolution-artifact | 🔴 Silent correctness (manual-accept regression) | Resolver writes `ResolveResult` (with `outcomes[]`) to `artifacts/reconcile-session.json`; reconcile.go:398 `saveReconcileArtifacts` overwrites with `ReconcileResult` (no outcomes); `loadResolvedFiles` reads outcomes → errors "no resolved files recorded". Fix: split into `resolution-session.json` (resolver) + `reconcile-session.json` (reconcile summary) | ✅ `4636878` |
| c3-manual-accept-regression-test | 🟡 Missing coverage | End-to-end shadow-awaiting → manual accept test. Counterpart to `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` but for the manual path. Would have caught both other C3 findings in v0.5.2 | ✅ `8a4af4b` |
| c3-accept-stamps-reconcile-outcome | 🟡 Internal consistency (M14.3 blocker) | `AcceptShadow` marks `State=applied` but leaves `Reconcile.Outcome=shadow-awaiting`. M14.3 label composition (ADR-011 D6) reads `Reconcile.Outcome` — stale outcome → wrong DAG labels | ✅ `3ac7465` |

### Session Summary — 2026-04-24 — C3 fix pass complete

Resumed the partial C3 run (resolver-session split + CLI reader already staged)
and completed the three outstanding deliverables:

- **Split artifact fully landed** (`4636878`): `internal/workflow/resolver.go`
  (`persistSession`), `internal/cli/cobra.go` (`loadResolvedFiles` +
  `shadow-diff`), `resolver_test.go`, and the Notes string in
  `reconcile.go:tryPhase35` all point at `resolution-session.json`. Drift
  audit updated the matching copy in 5 skill/prompt/workflow assets plus
  `docs/agent-as-provider.md` and `docs/prds/PRD-provider-conflict-resolver.md`.
  CHANGELOG, HISTORY, ADR-010, and M12 milestone are left historical.
- **AcceptShadow now stamps Outcome** (`3ac7465`):
  `clearShadowPointerAndStamp` signature extended to `(s, slug, sessionID, phase)`;
  sets `Reconcile.Outcome = ReconcileReapplied` and `Reconcile.AttemptedAt`.
  Auto-apply path unchanged externally (outer `updateFeatureState` still writes
  the same value on top); manual `reconcile --accept` now leaves a truthful
  `Outcome=reapplied` in status.json.
- **Regression test** (`8a4af4b`): `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow`
  in `internal/workflow/golden_reconcile_test.go` drives
  `RunReconcile(Resolve:true)` → parses `resolution-session.json` inline
  (mirroring `loadResolvedFiles`) → calls `workflow.AcceptShadow` → asserts
  merged content on disk, `State=applied`, `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied`,
  `ShadowPath` cleared, shadow directory pruned. Guards all three C3 fixes
  together.

### Commits (pushed to `origin/main`)

- `4636878` — fix(workflow): split resolver artifact into resolution-session.json
- `3ac7465` — fix(workflow): AcceptShadow stamps Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied
- `8a4af4b` — test(reconcile): end-to-end shadow-awaiting → manual accept regression

### Test results

```

`gofmt -l .` clean; `go build ./cmd/tpatch` succeeds.

### Files changed (drift audit — resolver context only)

Assets: `assets/skills/copilot/tessera-patch/SKILL.md`,
`assets/skills/cursor/tessera-patch.mdc`,
`assets/skills/windsurf/windsurfrules`,
`assets/workflows/tessera-patch-generic.md`,
`assets/prompts/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md`
(Claude SKILL.md was already updated by the prior sub-agent).

Docs: `docs/agent-as-provider.md`,
`docs/prds/PRD-provider-conflict-resolver.md`.

Intentionally left historical: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/handoff/HISTORY.md`,
`docs/supervisor/LOG.md`, `docs/adrs/ADR-010-*.md`,
`docs/milestones/M12-*.md`, `docs/milestones/M4-reconciliation.md`
(the latter refers to the classical phase-4 reconcile summary, which
legitimately still writes to `reconcile-session.json`).

### Next Steps

1. **Supervisor**: run the code-review sub-agent on the three C3 commits.
2. **Supervisor**: tag `v0.5.3`, bump version string, and add the
   v0.5.3 heading to `CHANGELOG.md` (implementation agent was explicitly
   instructed not to do any of these three).
3. **Supervisor**: unblock M14.1 once the review verdict lands.

### Artifact naming (locked: Option A)

- `artifacts/resolution-session.json` — resolver-owned, per-file `Outcomes[]`
- `artifacts/reconcile-session.json` — reconcile-owned, high-level `ReconcileResult` (unchanged external contract)

### Deferred behind v0.5.3

- M14.1 Data model + validation (~300 LOC)
- M14.2 Apply gate + `created_by` + 6-skill rollout (~250 LOC)
- M14.3 Reconcile topo + composable labels + compound verdict (~500 LOC)
- M14.4 `status --dag` + skills + release v0.6.0 (~300 LOC)

M14.3 will extend `workflow.AcceptShadow` (with the C3-stamped outcome) for the `blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution` compound verdict. C2+C3 correctness baselines are prerequisites.

### Registered follow-ups (not in any tranche yet)

- `feat-ephemeral-mode` — one-shot add-feature with no tracking artifacts; depends on `feat-feature-import` + `feat-delivery-modes`
- `feat-feature-reorder` — flip parent-child in DAG; depends on `feat-feature-dependencies`
- `feat-resolver-dag-context` — parent-patch to M12 resolver
- `feat-feature-autorebase` — auto-rebase child on parent drift
- `feat-amend-dependent-warning` — stale-parent-* labels
- `feat-skills-apply-auto-default` — 6 skills still reference `--mode prepare/execute/done`
- `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown` — `--lenient` fallback shipped; live repro pending
- `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary` — trivial; bundle into next release

## 2026-04-23 — Tranche C2 / v0.5.2 shipped

# Current Handoff

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: Tranche C2 / v0.5.2 — correctness fix pass (**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE — awaiting supervisor review + release**)
- **Status**: ✅ 6/6 code+doc items landed on `main`; release task is supervisor's (see Next Steps)
- **Blocks**: M14.1 — cannot start data model work until reconcile `--resolve --apply` is truthful and the `refresh.go` path no longer dirties the user's index (M14.3 extends both)
- **Next on deck after C2**: ADR-011 ✅ done → M14.1 data model + validation

### C2 fix scope (7 items, verified real)

|---|---|---|
| c2-resolve-apply-truthful | 🔴 Silent correctness bug | `--resolve --apply` sets `ReconcileReapplied` without copying shadow → real tree |
| c2-refresh-index-clean | 🟡 UX bug | `DiffFromCommitForPaths` leaves `git add -N` intent-to-add entries in user's index |

| c2-amend-append-flag | 🟢 Feature add | Lock replace-default, add explicit `--append`, mutex with `--reset` |
| c2-max-conflicts-drift | 🟢 Doc drift | 6 sites claim default 3; code is 10 (CHANGELOG, agent-as-provider, 4 shipped skill/prompt files) |
| c2-release-v0.5.2 | supervisor | Tag after code-review sub-agent approves |

### Why before M14.1

1. Finding #1 is silent correctness on the v0.5.0 headline feature (`--resolve --apply`). Building DAG on top compounds the bug × N features in M14.3's Kahn traversal.
2. M14.3 extends `refresh.go` (finding #2's code) — fix the temp-index leak once, inherit clean plumbing.
3. The **shared accept-helper** extraction (finding #1's preferred fix) is the exact primitive M14.3's `blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution` compound verdict will need.
4. Skills max-conflicts drift will be re-touched by M14.2/M14.4 parity-guard rollouts anyway — cleaner to fix drift before the DAG adds 3 new label strings to the same skill files.

### Deferred decisions locked in PRD (for M14 reference)

1. `depends_on` in `status.json` only (no new `feature.yaml`, no migration)
2. DFS for cycle detection, Kahn's algorithm for operator traversal
3. `waiting-on-parent` + `blocked-by-parent` are **composable derived labels** (not states)
4. `created_by` recipe op gated by **hard deps only**
5. `upstream_merged` satisfies hard deps
6. Child's own reconcile verdict **always computed first**; parent labels overlay clean verdicts
7. `remove --cascade` required to delete parents with dependents — `--force` alone does NOT bypass
8. Parent-patch context **NOT** passed to M12 resolver in v0.6 (deferred to `feat-resolver-dag-context`)
9. All gated by `features.dependencies` config flag until v0.6.0 atomic flip

See `docs/adrs/ADR-011-feature-dependencies.md` for full rationale.

### Tranche D scope (v0.6.0, after C2)

| Milestone | Scope | Est. LOC |
|---|---|---|
| M14.1 | Data model + validation (Dependency struct, cycle DFS, 5 rules) | ~300 |
| M14.2 | Apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout | ~250 |
| M14.3 | Reconcile topological traversal + composable labels + compound verdict | ~500 |
| M14.4 | `status --dag` + skills + release v0.6.0 | ~300 |

### Registered follow-ups (not in any tranche yet)

- `feat-ephemeral-mode` — one-shot add-feature mode with no tracking artifacts; depends on `feat-feature-import` + `feat-delivery-modes`
- `feat-feature-reorder` — flip parent-child in DAG; depends on `feat-feature-dependencies`
- `feat-resolver-dag-context` — parent-patch to M12 resolver
- `feat-feature-autorebase` — auto-rebase child on parent drift
- `feat-amend-dependent-warning` — stale-parent-* labels
- `feat-skills-apply-auto-default` — 6 skills still reference `--mode prepare/execute/done`; v0.5.1 flip not documented
- `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown` — shipped `--lenient` fallback only; needs live repro for root-cause fix
- `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary` — trivial one-liner; bundle into next release

## Session Summary — 2026-04-24 — C2 fix pass complete (6/6 code+doc items landed)

All 6 code/doc findings from the C2 correctness pass have landed on `main`. Remaining todo is the supervisor's release task (tag v0.5.2 + CHANGELOG heading) — implementation work is done.

### Commits (on `main`, after `f5e6d9e`)

| # | Finding | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | c2-max-conflicts-drift (docs: default 3 → 10 across 8 sites) | `36e058d` |
| 2 | c2-remove-piped-stdin (`printf y\|tpatch remove` now auto-yes on pipe) | `dbf7a31` |
| 3 | c2-amend-append-flag (add `--append`, mutex with `--reset`) | `1c6697e` |
| 4 | c2-refresh-index-clean (`DiffFromCommitForPaths` uses throwaway `GIT_INDEX_FILE`) | `bc938ec` |
| 5 | c2-recipe-hash-provenance (stale guard detects content drift via sha256) | `b5e1f88` |
| 6 | c2-resolve-apply-truthful (`--resolve --apply` actually copies shadow → real) | `73cd648` |

### Key design choices

- **Shared `workflow.AcceptShadow` helper** (new file `internal/workflow/accept.go`) now owns the accept sequence. Both `runReconcileAccept` (manual `--accept`) and the auto-apply branch in `reconcile.go`'s `tryPhase35` route through it — they cannot drift again. On mid-flight failure the shadow is preserved and the outcome flips to `ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman` so the human can investigate.
- **`RecipeProvenance.RecipeSHA256` is a `*string` pointer** so legacy sidecars (no field) decode as `nil` and `warnRecipeStale` emits a one-line "predates recipe-hash guard" note instead of a false-positive stale warning. Forward-compatible.
- **`GIT_INDEX_FILE` approach for `DiffFromCommitForPaths`**: seed a `os.CreateTemp("", "tpatch-idx-*")` file from `.git/index` bytes, run both `git add -N` and `git diff` with `GIT_INDEX_FILE=<temp>`, delete on return. Zero leakage to the user's real index.
- **`canPromptForConfirmation` + `os.Pipe` in tests**: pipes report `false` (not a TTY), matching real `printf y|tpatch remove`. The existing `SetIn(strings.NewReader(...))` path still reports `true` via the `*os.File` type-check fallback, preserving existing test behavior.

### Fixed drift sites (8, not 6 — also found cursor + windsurf drifts)

`CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/agent-as-provider.md`, `assets/workflows/tessera-patch-generic.md`, `assets/prompts/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md`, `assets/skills/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.md`, `assets/skills/cursor/tessera-patch.mdc`, `assets/skills/claude/tessera-patch.md`, `assets/skills/windsurf/.windsurfrules`.

## Files Changed (tranche C2 aggregate)

- `internal/workflow/accept.go` — **NEW** — shared `AcceptShadow` + `AcceptOptions` / `AcceptResult`.
- `internal/workflow/accept_test.go` — **NEW** — direct coverage + failure-path test.
- `internal/workflow/reconcile.go` — `ResolveVerdictAutoAccepted` branch rewired through `AcceptShadow`; failure → `BlockedRequiresHuman` + shadow preserved.
- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — `RecipeProvenance.RecipeSHA256 *string`; provenance now re-reads recipe and hashes it.
- `internal/workflow/refresh_test.go` — `TestRefreshAfterAcceptLeavesIndexClean` regression guard.
- `internal/workflow/golden_reconcile_test.go` — `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` end-to-end guard.
- `internal/gitutil/gitutil.go` — `DiffFromCommitForPaths` uses `GIT_INDEX_FILE` throwaway.
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — extended `warnRecipeStale` for HEAD + hash + legacy; `runReconcileAccept` rewritten as thin wrapper over `workflow.AcceptShadow`.
- `internal/cli/c1.go` — `amendCmd` gained `--append` + mutex with `--reset`; `removeCmd` skips prompt on piped stdin.
- `internal/cli/cobra_test.go` — stale-guard content-drift + legacy subtests, `TestRemovePipedStdinSkipsConfirmation`, `TestAmendAppendConcatenates`, `TestAmendAppendAndResetRejected`.
- 8 drift-fix sites (see list above).

## Test Results

- `gofmt -l .` — clean.
- `go build ./...` — ok.
- `go test ./...` — all packages green (assets, cli, gitutil, provider, safety, store, workflow).
- No new Go deps.

## Next Steps

1. **Supervisor**: dispatch code-review sub-agent for the 6 C2 commits (`36e058d..73cd648`).
2. **Supervisor** (on APPROVED): write `v0.5.2` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`, bump internal version string if present, commit as `release(v0.5.2)`, tag `v0.5.2`, push `main` + tag.
3. After v0.5.2 tag: archive this CURRENT entry to HISTORY and open the M14.1 data-model handoff.

## Blockers

None. C2 implementation is complete.

## Context for Next Agent

- **Do NOT run `go build ./cmd/tpatch` at repo root** — writes a bare `tpatch` binary not covered by `.gitignore` (registered follow-up `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary`). Use `go vet + go test`.
- **`AcceptShadow` is the new single entry point** for anything that wants to promote a shadow into the real tree. Do not open-code the sequence in callers — use the helper.
- **`RecipeProvenance.RecipeSHA256` being a pointer is load-bearing**: if a future refactor flips it to a value type, legacy sidecars will appear stale and emit spurious warnings. Change only with a migration.
- **Auto-apply failure mode is `ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman` with shadow preserved** (ADR-010 §D4). Tests `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` and `TestAcceptShadowErrorsWithoutShadow` lock this in.

## Session Summary — 2026-04-23 — PRD approved, C2 fix pass opened

Supervisor-driven: after ADR-011 shipped, reviewer session surfaced 4 confirmed bugs + 2 doc drifts. Verified findings #1, #2, #6 via direct code inspection (resolver.go:218-222 comment is explicit; gitutil.go:689-697 leaks intent-to-add; 6 skill/doc sites claim max-conflicts default 3 against code's 10). Registered 7 C2 todos with dependencies; M14.1 blocked behind v0.5.2 release.

## Files Changed

- `docs/prds/PRD-feature-dependencies.md` — NEW — 736 lines
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — M14 section populated
- `docs/supervisor/LOG.md` — PRD review cycle entry
- `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` — this file, flipped to M14 scoping state

## Test Results

N/A — docs-only session.

## Next Steps

1. Draft ADR-011 (can be done as a sub-agent task or directly by supervisor — small scope).
2. Create `docs/milestones/M14-feature-dependencies.md` with the 4-sub-milestone contract.
3. Launch M14.1 implementation sub-agent once ADR-011 is in place.

## Blockers

None. ADR-011 is the only gating artifact before M14.1 coding starts.

## Context for Next Agent

- PRD review had **3 passes** and every pass improved the artifact materially — this is the pattern for non-trivial features. Budget review cycles, don't treat first-pass approval as the norm.
- Rubber-duck agent is highly effective at catching self-introduced contradictions in revisions. Always re-review after revisions.
- `m14.1-data-model` must not start until ADR-011 is committed — it's a repo rule per AGENTS.md.
- PRD has ONE non-blocking cleanup note: §3.4 still uses enum-style `ReconcileWaitingOnParent` / `ReconcileBlockedByParent` verdicts while §4.5 locks label semantics. ADR-011 should normalize (labels win).

### Post-release user testing

User did manual testing after release — no bugs reported. Removed the stray `tpatch` build artifact from repo root manually.

### Registered follow-ups (not in any tranche yet)

- **Skill-asset refresh for apply default flip** — all 6 skill formats + `docs/agent-as-provider.md` still reference `apply --mode prepare/execute/done` explicitly. New `--mode auto` default is not documented there. Low-priority polish; cluster with next skill touch.
- **`bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown`** — shipped `--lenient` fallback only. Real repro needed to root-cause. Re-open if a user reports live.
- **`.gitignore /tpatch`** — bare binary at repo root from `go build ./cmd/tpatch` is not gitignored. Trivial one-line fix bundled into next tranche.

## Session Summary — 2026-04-22 — Tranche C1 / v0.5.1 shipped

10 commits on `main`, pushed to `origin`. Tag `v0.5.1` pushed. All tests green. No new Go deps.

| # | Item | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | c1-recipe-stale-guard | `4f49c76` |
| 2 | c1-apply-default-execute | `3a12b2e` |
| 3 | c1-add-stdin | `d727ea2` |
| 4 | c1-progress-indicator | `5dba3b4` |
| 5 | c1-edit-flag | `1dbc812` |
| 6 | c1-feature-amend | `36587c9` |
| 7 | c1-feature-removal | `958e6d0` |
| 8 | c1-record-lenient | `5dae00b` |
| 9 | release(v0.5.1) | `e069cd8` + tag `v0.5.1` |
| 10 | supervisor log: C1 review — APPROVED | `c4cccb3` |

### Breaking UX

- `tpatch apply` default mode flipped from `prepare` to `auto`. Users relying on the previous behavior must pass `--mode prepare` explicitly.

### Notes for next agent

- **Item 8 shipped as fallback, not root-cause fix.** Three synthetic repros of `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown` (trailing whitespace, new untracked markdown with `--intent-to-add`, modified tracked markdown) all passed reverse-apply cleanly. Without a live fixture, I shipped the documented `--lenient` escape hatch instead of a speculative `--ignore-whitespace` fix. If the bug resurfaces with a real repro, revisit.
- **Recipe provenance is a sidecar** (`artifacts/recipe-provenance.json`), not a field on `apply-recipe.json` — avoids changing all 6 skill formats + failing the strict `DisallowUnknownFields` parity guard.
- **Spinner lives at the single `GenerateWithRetry` choke point.** Any new LLM-calling code path gets the spinner for free if it goes through that function.
- **`.gitignore` does NOT ignore a bare `tpatch` binary at repo root.** Don't `go build ./cmd/tpatch` from the root — it writes a binary that gets picked up by `git add -A`. Use `go vet + go test` only.
- **Stdin detection pattern**: `stdinIsPiped` (permissive — true for tests that use `cmd.SetIn(strings.NewReader(...))`) for input; `canPromptForConfirmation` (inverse, requires real TTY) for destructive ops.

## Files Changed (tranche C1 aggregate)

- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — version bump, apply default mode flip, addCmd stdin, stale-guard, record --lenient, c1 subcommand registrations.
- `internal/cli/c1.go` — NEW — edit/amend/remove commands.
- `internal/cli/cobra_test.go` — tests for all C1 items + shared helpers.
- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — `RecipeProvenance` sidecar.
- `internal/workflow/spinner.go` (NEW) + `spinner_test.go` (NEW).
- `internal/workflow/retry.go` — spinner wired in `GenerateWithRetry`.
- `internal/store/store.go` — `RemoveFeature`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — v0.5.1 section.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — M13 status flipped to ✅.
- `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` + `docs/handoff/HISTORY.md` — archived.

## Test Results

- `gofmt -l .` — clean.
- `go vet ./...` — clean.
- `go test ./...` — all packages green.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Supervisor review of C1 commits — APPROVED (see `docs/supervisor/LOG.md`).
2. ✅ Pushed `main` + tag `v0.5.1` to `origin`.
3. ⏭️ Pick next tranche from ROADMAP M14+ backlog (see supervisor proposal in latest chat turn).

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Agent

- All C1 commits are single-purpose and can be reverted individually if any one item is rejected in review.
- `--mode prepare` → `--mode auto` default flip is the only user-visible regression risk. Skill assets were NOT updated in this tranche (still say "apply --mode prepare/started/done") — worth a follow-up touch if the new default sticks.

SQL: `SELECT id, status FROM todos WHERE id LIKE 'b2-%' ORDER BY id;`

### What `b2-cli-flags` needs to do (NEXT)

Add flags to `reconcileCmd` in `internal/cli/cobra.go`:

- `--resolve` bool → `ReconcileOptions.Resolve`
- `--apply` bool → `ReconcileOptions.Apply` (requires `--resolve`)
- `--max-conflicts N` int → `ReconcileOptions.MaxConflicts`
- `--model NAME` string → `ReconcileOptions.Model`
- `--accept <slug>`, `--reject <slug>`, `--shadow-diff <slug>` — terminal operations; read `status.Reconcile.ShadowPath` (already populated by b2-state-machine). Mutually exclusive with `--resolve`.

Handler sketch:

- `--accept`: refuse if state != `reconciling-shadow`. Look up resolved_files from `reconcile-session.json`. Call `gitutil.CopyShadowToReal(shadow, root, files)`. Transition state to `applied` via `s.MarkFeatureState`. Add TODO note: "derived artifacts not yet refreshed — run `tpatch record` until b2-derived-refresh lands."
- `--reject`: `gitutil.PruneShadow(shadow)`. Roll state back to `applied`. Clear `status.Reconcile.ShadowPath`.
- `--shadow-diff`: walk resolved_files, shell out to `diff -u` per pair, stream to stdout.

Also: truthful validation errors for nonsensical combos (e.g. `--accept` + `--resolve`).

### What was in the old wiring guidance (preserved below for reference — all implemented)

1. **Trigger condition**: only when `PreviewForwardApply` returns `ForwardApply3WayConflicts` AND the caller set `ReconcileOpts.Resolve = true` (new field — add to the opts struct).
2. **Git plumbing** (new, needs a helper in gitutil or inline): for each conflicted file from the preview, fetch three versions:
   - `base` = file at the feature's base upstream commit (from `upstream.lock` or the patch's base)
   - `ours` = file after feature's patch is applied on `base` (either read from real working tree if currently on base+patch, OR synthesize: `git show <base>:<path>` + apply feature's post-apply.patch selectively).
   - `theirs` = `git show <upstreamCommit>:<path>`
   - Simplest v0.5.0 approach: use `git show <ref>:<path>` via `runGit` for base and theirs; for ours, read the file from the real working tree (reconcile runs after `tpatch apply` has put the feature on disk). Document the assumption.
3. **Call `RunConflictResolve`** with the gathered `ConflictInput`s and `upstreamCommit`. Pass through `ResolveOptions{AutoApply: opts.Apply, ModelOverride: opts.Model, MaxConflicts: opts.MaxConflicts, Validation: ValidationConfig{TestCommand: cfg.TestCommand, IdentifierCheck: true}}`.
4. **Map `ResolveResult` → `ReconcileResult`**: new `ReconcileOutcome` values mirror the resolver verdicts. Add `ShadowPath`, `ResolvedFiles`, `FailedFiles`, `SkippedFiles` to `ReconcileResult`.
5. **Preserve v0.4.4 `promoteIfMarkers`** on every Reapplied path that bypasses phase 3.5 (when `--resolve` is off). Already present; just make sure new branching doesn't orphan it.
6. **Skip phase 3.5 entirely** when forward-apply preview verdict is anything other than `3WayConflicts` — the resolver only exists to turn that verdict into something actionable.

### Key technical facts (for a fresh agent)

- **Module path**: `github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch` (renamed from `tesserabox` on 2026-04-21).
- **Provider interface**: `provider.Provider{ Check, Generate }`. Resolver uses `Generate` only. `cfg.Configured()` is the "usable?" check.
- **Store API**: `s.ReadFeatureFile(slug, name)`, `s.WriteArtifact(slug, name, content)`, `s.LoadConfig()`, `s.Root` (repo root). Flat YAML config.
- **Shadow path**: `.tpatch/shadow/<slug>-<ts>/` where ts is `2006-01-02T15-04-05.000000Z`. Microsecond precision — required to avoid collisions on rapid recreate.
- **No heuristic fallback** (ADR-010 D9): when provider not configured, resolver returns `BlockedRequiresHuman` with per-file `provider-error` status. Never degrade silently.
- **Fence stripping**: use `stripResolverFences` (conservative whole-response regex), NOT `stripCodeFences` (JSON-lenient). Documented in resolver.go.
- **Validation**: `ValidateResolvedFile` runs markers + native-parse + identifier-preservation (opt-in). `RunTestCommandInShadow` is a SEPARATE call, run after all files resolve.
- **Session JSON**: written on EVERY path, including short-circuit verdicts (too-many-conflicts, no-provider). Auditability > optimization.
- **Parity guard**: `assets/assets_test.go` has `TestSkillRecipeSchemaMatchesCLI` with `DisallowUnknownFields`. Any skill edit that invents a field fails build. B2 skill update must extend the anchors + recipe schema carefully.

### Follow-ups registered (post-B2, later tranches)

- `feat-resolver-heuristic-fallback` — opt-in `--heuristic` for provider-unavailable cases. Depends on `b2-release`.
- `feat-feature-standalonify` — rebase a dependent feature into standalone. Depends on `feat-feature-dependencies`.
- `feat-parallel-feature-workflows` — `tpatch workon --parallel` fans out features into per-feature worktrees. Depends on `feat-feature-dependencies`.

### Bugs fixed in v0.5.0 alongside B2

- `bug-features-md-stale-state` — `FEATURES.md` not regenerated on state transitions from `apply --mode done` / `record` / etc. Fix: `SaveFeatureStatus` now calls `RefreshFeaturesIndex` unconditionally. Regression test: `TestSaveFeatureStatusRefreshesIndex`.

## Session Summary (2026-04-22 session — B2 derived-refresh + golden-tests)

**Commits this session** (continuing):
- `c022b19` — b2-cli-flags (prior)
- `3aab0c4` — docs checkpoint (prior)
- `1507b7a` — **b2-derived-refresh**: accept-flow correctness fix + atomic post-apply.patch regen + numbered reconcile patch + 4 tests
- (this commit) — **b2-golden-tests**: 5 ADR-010 PRD#6 acceptance scenarios

All pushed. `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go test ./...` clean.

### `b2-derived-refresh` fixed a real bug

The prior `--accept` only copied resolved (conflicted) files from the shadow.
Non-conflicted hunks from `post-apply.patch` were **never applied** to the real
tree, leaving the feature half-reconciled. New accept flow:

1. `ForwardApplyExcluding(patch, resolvedFiles)` — non-conflicted hunks land via 3-way
2. `CopyShadowToReal(resolvedFiles)` — resolver output overlays those paths
3. `RefreshAfterAccept` — regenerates post-apply.patch restricted to originally-touched files (via `git diff <upstreamCommit> -- <paths>` with `git add -N` first so new files appear); snapshots new patch as `patches/NNN-reconcile.patch`
4. `MarkFeatureState → applied`; prune shadow; clear status pointer

Explicitly deferred: `apply-recipe.json` regen (lossy from a raw diff);
documented in `refresh.go`. `tpatch record` remains the fallback.

### `b2-golden-tests` — 5 scenarios via `RunReconcile`

File: `internal/workflow/golden_reconcile_test.go`

| Scenario | Fixture | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|
| clean-reapply | Non-conflicting feature vs unchanged upstream | `reapplied` / `upstreamed`, no shadow |
| shadow-awaiting | Conflict + provider returns clean merge | `shadow-awaiting`, 1 resolved, shadow populated |
| validation-failed | Conflict + provider returns content with `<<<<<<<` markers | `blocked-requires-human`, 1 failed |
| too-many-conflicts | 2 conflicted files, MaxConflicts=1 | `blocked-too-many-conflicts`, provider.calls==0 |
| no-provider | Conflict + nil provider + `--resolve` | `blocked-requires-human`, no shadow |

Pattern reuses `scriptedProvider` with `keyed` map for resolver calls + positional response for phase-3 semantic probe. Fixtures capture real `git diff --cached HEAD` output so `--3way` can locate the base blob.

## Session Summary (2026-04-22 session — B2 cli-flags)

**Commits this session** (continuing from b2-state-machine):
- `53b38ee` — `b2-reconcile-wiring` (prior)
- `1767c1d` — `b2-state-machine` (prior)
- `6229203` — docs checkpoint (prior)
- (this commit) — `b2-cli-flags`: 7 new `tpatch reconcile` flags + 3 terminal handlers (accept/reject/shadow-diff) + mutex validation + 2 tests

All pushed. All tests green. `gofmt`, `go vet` clean.

### What `b2-cli-flags` shipped

- `--resolve`, `--apply`, `--max-conflicts`, `--model` → wired into `ReconcileOptions` struct
- `--accept <slug>`: reads `reconcile-session.json`, copies resolved files via `gitutil.CopyShadowToReal`, transitions state to `applied`, prunes shadow, clears status pointer. TODO emitted pointing to `tpatch record` (derived-refresh deferred)
- `--reject <slug>`: prunes shadow, rolls state back to `applied` if parked in `reconciling-shadow`
- `--shadow-diff <slug>`: non-destructive; streams `gitutil.ShadowDiff` to stdout
- `validateReconcileFlags`: rejects terminal-op combos + `--apply` without `--resolve`
- Safety: terminal ops never call `openStoreFromCmd` before flag validation

## Session Summary (2026-04-22 session — B2 middle)

**Commits this session** (continuing from B2 kickoff):
- `ed8457b` — docs: checkpoint B2 progress in CURRENT.md

---

## Prior session summary (v0.4.4 + org rename)

Two HIGH bugs from the t3code v0.4.3 live stress test fixed and shipped.

1. **Skill recipe schema mismatch** — v0.4.3 skills documented `op`/`contents`/`occurrences`/`delete-file`; CLI reads `type`/`content`/no-occurrences/no-delete-file. Corrected all 6 skills + `docs/agent-as-provider.md`. Added `TestSkillRecipeSchemaMatchesCLI` — extracts every ```json block, unmarshals into `workflow.RecipeOperation` with `DisallowUnknownFields`, and validates op types. Prevents future drift.

2. **Reconcile reapplied-with-conflict-markers** — the degraded `PreviewForwardApply` fallback used to return `3WayClean` when `git worktree add` failed, undoing v0.4.2 A4. Now returns `Blocked`. Added `ScanConflictMarkers` defensive pass on the live tree after every Reapplied verdict; markers promote to Blocked. New test `TestReconcilePromotesOnLiveMarkers`.

Both bugs were direct B2 prerequisites (agents need a correct recipe schema; B2's resolver hooks on `3WayConflicts` which phase 4 was silently skipping).

## Files Changed

- `assets/skills/claude/tessera-patch/SKILL.md` — recipe schema block rewritten (`type`/`content`, append-file documented, delete-file/occurrences disclaimer).
- `assets/skills/copilot/tessera-patch/SKILL.md`, `assets/prompts/copilot/tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md`, `assets/skills/cursor/tessera-patch.mdc`, `assets/skills/windsurf/windsurfrules`, `assets/workflows/tessera-patch-generic.md` — recipe JSON block + semantics rewritten to match CLI.
- `docs/agent-as-provider.md` — recipe schema rewritten.
- `assets/assets_test.go` — new `TestSkillRecipeSchemaMatchesCLI`.
- `internal/gitutil/gitutil.go` — `PreviewForwardApply` degraded path returns Blocked; `ScanConflictMarkers` exported.
- `internal/workflow/reconcile.go` — `promoteIfMarkers` defensive pass on Reapplied paths.
- `internal/workflow/reconcile_test.go` — `TestReconcilePromotesOnLiveMarkers` regression.
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — version → 0.4.4.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — v0.4.4 section.

## Test Results

- `gofmt -l .` — clean.
- `go build ./...` — ok.
- `go test ./...` — all packages pass. Two new tests green (`TestSkillRecipeSchemaMatchesCLI`, `TestReconcilePromotesOnLiveMarkers`).

## Next Steps — pick Tranche B2 scope

1. **Option A — `feat-provider-conflict-resolver`** (ADR-010, v0.5.0 headline): phase 3.5 in reconcile, shadow worktree, per-file provider call. The core value prop. Now unblocked by v0.4.4.
2. **Option B — Recipe modernisation**: `feat-recipe-schema-expansion` (add `delete-file`, `rename-file`, op aliases) + `feat-record-autogen-recipe` (derive recipe from diff on record). Makes Path B fully self-contained.
3. **Option C — `feat-feature-dependencies` DAG**: first-class depends_on plumbing; unlocks stacked features and ordered reconcile.

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Agent

- The new `TestSkillRecipeSchemaMatchesCLI` is strict (`DisallowUnknownFields`). Any future skill edit that invents a field will fail the build at the assets test. If the CLI adds a field (e.g. `occurrences`), update both `workflow.RecipeOperation` and the skills in the same commit.
- `ScanConflictMarkers` is now public (`gitutil.ScanConflictMarkers`). Reuse it anywhere a "did this really succeed?" check is needed (e.g. after `apply --mode execute`).
- The degraded path in `PreviewForwardApply` now refuses to guess. If users start seeing "worktree preview unavailable — refusing to guess", they have a real environment issue (bare repo, disk full, permissions) that was previously being masked.

## Archived 2026-04-20 — v0.4.2 Tranche A handoff (superseded by B1 --manual flag landing)

# Current Handoff

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: v0.4.2 released — Tranche A "Truthful Errors" complete
- **Milestone**: All 10 Tranche A items (A1–A10) landed + `docs/{record,feature-layout,reconcile}.md` shipped.
- **Status**: Ready to tag `v0.4.2`. No open Tranche A work.
- **Next**: Tranche B kickoff — headline is `feat-provider-conflict-resolver`. Full backlog in session SQL `todos` table (32 pending feature/improvement todos).

## Session Summary

One full v0.4.2 release cycle landed in this session:

- **A1 bug-implement-silent-fallback** — `Config.MaxTokensImplement` knob (default 16384, was hard-coded 8192). New `WarnWriter io.Writer = os.Stderr` in `internal/workflow/implement.go`; fallback emits a stderr warning naming retry count, error, raw-response path, and the config knob.
- **A2 bug-cycle-state-mismatch** — `RunImplement` writes `StateImplementing`. `assertCycleState` + `featureStateRank` check every phase transition in `internal/cli/phase2.go`.
- **A3 bug-record-validation-false-positive** — new `gitutil.ValidatePatchReverse`. Record now validates round-trip against the tree it captured from; forward validation stays for reconcile.
- **A4 bug-reconcile-phase4-false-positive** — new `gitutil.PreviewForwardApply` runs `--3way` in an isolated `git worktree` and classifies `Strict | 3WayClean | 3WayConflicts | Blocked`. Conflicts promote to `ReconcileBlocked`.
- **A5 bug-skill-invocation-clarity** — three canonical top-of-file blocks (Invocation / Phase Ordering / Preflight) in all 6 skill formats. Parity guard (`assets/assets_test.go`) enforces anchor phrases — wording can't drift.
- **A6 bug-provider-set-global** — `tpatch provider set` defaults to the global config; `--repo` for per-repo override. New `TestMain` in `internal/cli/phase2_test.go` redirects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` so tests cannot clobber the developer's machine config.
- **A7 bug-extract-json-robustness** — one `ExtractJSONObject` helper replaces four extractors. Brace-balanced, string-aware, handles trailing prose / nested / arrays / escaped quotes / fences. 11-case table test.
- **A8 doc-record-timing** — `tpatch record` refuses clean-tree-no-`--from` with a "captured 0 bytes" diagnostic + up to 10 `git log` candidates. New helpers: `gitutil.RecentCommits`, `gitutil.IsWorkingTreeDirty`. Plus `docs/record.md` + skill one-liner.
- **A9 doc-patches-vs-artifacts** — `docs/feature-layout.md` with the "canonical vs audit trail" callout. `tpatch record` prints a cleanup hint past 6 patches. CLI subcommand (`tpatch patches`) + dedup deferred to v0.5.x (`feat-patches-subcommand`, `feat-record-dedup-patches`).
- **A10 doc-reconcile-workflow** — new `gitutil.PreflightReconcile` + `ReconcilePreflight` struct. `tpatch reconcile` refuses dirty trees / conflict markers / `*.orig|*.rej`. New flags: `--preflight`, `--allow-dirty`. Untracked-`.tpatch/` tip. `docs/reconcile.md` + skill one-liner.

### Version / release

- `internal/cli/cobra.go`: `const version = "0.4.2"`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: new file, v0.4.2 section written.
- Commit + tag `v0.4.2` pending at time of handoff write.

## Files Changed (net vs v0.4.1)

New files:
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/record.md`
- `docs/feature-layout.md`
- `docs/reconcile.md`
- `internal/workflow/jsonextract.go` + `jsonextract_test.go`
- `internal/workflow/implement_test.go` (A1/A2)
- `internal/gitutil/gitutil_test.go` (A3/A4/A10)

Substantial edits:
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — record empty-capture refusal, reconcile preflight + flags, `providerSetCmd` global default, version bump.
- `internal/cli/phase2.go` — `assertCycleState`, `featureStateRank`.
- `internal/cli/phase2_test.go` — `TestMain` XDG isolation, 3 new regression tests.
- `internal/gitutil/gitutil.go` — `ValidatePatchReverse`, `PreviewForwardApply`, `RecentCommits`, `IsWorkingTreeDirty`, `IsPathTracked`, `PreflightReconcile`.
- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — `WarnWriter`, state transition fix, MaxTokens knob, `ExtractJSONObject` migration.
- `internal/workflow/workflow.go`, `retry.go`, `reconcile.go` — migrated to `ExtractJSONObject`.
- `internal/store/{types,store,global}.go` — `MaxTokensImplement` knob.
- All 6 skill files (Claude / Copilot / Cursor / Windsurf / Generic / prompt) — 3 canonical blocks + 2 one-liners (record timing, reconcile clean tree).
- `assets/assets_test.go` — `requiredAnchors` list (10 anchors total).

## Next Steps

1. Single commit with all v0.4.2 changes + co-author trailer; tag `v0.4.2`; push.
2. Begin Tranche B. Top of the backlog: **`feat-provider-conflict-resolver`** — a dedicated LLM-assisted resolver that can process phase-4 3-way conflicts instead of bubbling them up as `blocked`. Natural fit with `feat-soft-recipe-mode` (guidance recipes reconcile more easily).
3. Secondary Tranche B candidates (from session SQL):
   - `feat-feature-amend` — amend an already-recorded feature from an in-tree edit.
   - `feat-noncontiguous-feature-commits` — per-feature commit ledger for features that span discontiguous commits.
   - `feat-init-skill-drift` — apt/dpkg-style skill reconciliation on re-init.
   - `feat-max-tokens-uncapped` — research OpenRouter / LiteLLM / OpenCode conventions before deciding.
4. Stretch (v0.6.0): `feat-ci-cd-integration`, `feat-autoresearch-iterate-until-green`, `feat-delivery-modes`.

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Agent

- Session SQL is the authoritative task tracker. 29 pending todos, 49 done at this point.
- All three new docs in `docs/` (`record.md`, `feature-layout.md`, `reconcile.md`) cross-link to each other and `SPEC.md`. When adding another lifecycle doc, follow the same Related section pattern.
- The parity guard (`assets/assets_test.go` `requiredAnchors`) is now the enforcement surface for "what must all skill files say verbatim". When adding a skill block, add an anchor here or it will silently drift.
- `TestMain` in `internal/cli/phase2_test.go` redirects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Any new CLI test that writes provider / global config MUST run in the `internal/cli` package (not elsewhere) to inherit that isolation.
- Reconcile preflight is now a hard gate. When writing tests that exercise reconcile phases, stage a fully clean tree first OR pass `--allow-dirty`.
- The `WarnWriter` pattern (see implement.go) is the convention for non-fatal workflow warnings. Swappable in tests via `prev := WarnWriter; WarnWriter = &buf; defer func() { WarnWriter = prev }()`.

## Archived 2026-04-18 — M11 handoff (superseded by v0.4.2 Tranche A)

# Current Handoff

## Active Task
- **Task ID**: M11 — Native Copilot provider (ADR-005)
- **Milestone**: M11 delivered
- **Description**: First-party Go provider speaking directly to `api.githubcopilot.com`. Mirrors the copilot-api/litellm pattern: device-code OAuth → session-token exchange → editor headers.
- **Status**: Implemented; awaiting supervisor review.
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-18

## Session Summary

1. **Auth store** (`internal/provider/copilot_auth.go`) — schema
   `{version, oauth, session}`, atomic write at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tpatch/copilot-auth.json`
   with 0600 perms, rejects symlinks + world/group-writable parent dirs, tightens
   file perms on load, `TPATCH_COPILOT_AUTH_FILE` env override for tests,
   `authStoreMu` serialises writes + refreshes.
2. **Device-code flow** (`internal/provider/copilot_login.go`) — `RequestDeviceCode`,
   `PollAccessToken` (honours `authorization_pending`, permanent `slow_down` bump,
   `expired_token`, `access_denied`, local deadline + ctx cancel, always sends
   `Accept: application/json`), `ExchangeSessionToken` (+ `…Locked` variant used
   by the provider's retry-on-401 path). Client ID `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`
   matches copilot-api.
3. **Editor headers** (`internal/provider/copilot_headers.go`) — version
   constants tracking copilot-api 0.26.7, `x-request-id` uuid, `TODO(adr-005)`
   to refresh when upstream bumps.
4. **Provider impl** (`internal/provider/copilot_native.go`) — `CopilotNative`
   satisfies `Provider`. `Check` never initiates device flow (returns
   `errCopilotUnauthorized` if no auth file). `Generate` proactively refreshes
   the session 60s before expiry, retries once on 401 with a forced refresh,
   then fails. Routes via `auth.Session.Endpoints["api"]` verbatim (D5).
5. **Registry** — `provider.NewFromConfig` dispatches
   `CopilotNativeType = "copilot-native"`. `Config.Configured()` relaxed for
   copilot-native so `Model` alone is enough (`BaseURL` comes from the auth
   file). New `Config.Initiator` field plumbed through `store.ProviderConfig`,
   the YAML parser, `SaveConfig`, and `renderGlobalYAML`.
6. **Opt-in gate** — `store.AcknowledgeCopilotNativeOptIn`,
   `store.CopilotNativeOptedIn`, plus `CopilotNativeOptIn` + `…At` fields
   written to **global config only** (same class as `CopilotAUPAckAt`) so they
   don't leak via repo clones. Enforced in `providerSetCmd`, `config set`
   (`provider.type=copilot-native`), and implicitly in auto-detect (which never
   lists copilot-native as a candidate).
7. **CLI** (`internal/cli/copilot_native.go`) — `provider copilot-login`
   (enterprise prompt, device flow, AUP notice), `provider copilot-logout`
   (deletes auth file). Re-uses AUP language from M10.
8. **Config set** — `config set provider.copilot_native_optin true` routes
   to `SaveGlobalConfig` (rubber-duck #3); `config set provider.initiator`
   validates `""|user|agent`.
9. **Preset** — `--preset copilot-native` in `providerPresets` (empty
   BaseURL, default model `claude-sonnet-4`, empty AuthEnv).
10. **Version bump** — `0.4.0-dev`.
11. **Docs** — new `docs/faq.md` (macOS `~/Library/Application Support`
    caveat + `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` override + auth-file locations); harness
    doc `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` gains "Native path (experimental,
    opt-in)" section; ROADMAP M11 marked ✅.

## Next Steps
1. Supervisor review per `AGENTS.md` cadence → approve → tag `v0.4.0`
   so the CI release job publishes notes.
2. Live smoke test against a real GitHub account with Copilot entitlement:
   - `tpatch config set provider.copilot_native_optin true`
   - `tpatch provider copilot-login`
   - `tpatch provider set --preset copilot-native`
   - `tpatch provider check`
   - full `tpatch cycle` of a toy feature.
3. Follow-up: add provider-level unit tests with an httptest fake for
   the device flow + session exchange + 401 retry (scaffolded but not
   included in this cut to keep the diff surgical).

## Blockers
None. Editor-header policy is a known unknown per ADR-005 OQ1; we ship
with editor headers until GitHub publishes an official compatibility
endpoint.

## Context for Next Agent
- `CopilotAuthFilePath()` returns `(string, error)` — don't call it as a
  single-value expression.
- `ExchangeSessionToken(ctx, opts, auth)` **mutates `auth` in place** and
  returns only `error`. That's intentional: the provider's retry-on-401
  path needs to refresh the in-memory struct without re-reading the file
  before writing.
- `CopilotSessionBlock.Endpoints["api"]` is the routing root. Treat it as
  opaque — don't parse or reconstruct it.
- `authStoreMu` guards **both** the file and `exchangeSessionTokenLocked`;
  always call `ExchangeSessionToken` (the public wrapper) unless you
  already hold the mutex.
- macOS + `os.UserConfigDir()` resolves to `~/Library/Application Support/tpatch/`.
  Documented in `docs/faq.md`; users who want XDG layout set
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

## 2026-04-17 — Distribution Setup (module rename + CI workflow) (v0.3.0)

**Task**: Enable 'go install' + add free CI workflow
**Agent**: Distribution agent
**Verdict**: APPROVED — committed as dc42718 + 305781d, tagged v0.3.0

## Session Summary

Two operational follow-ups:

1. **Module path fixed to match repo** — `go.mod` said `github.com/tesseracode/tpatch` while the GitHub repo is `tesseracode/tesserapatch`. That mismatch blocks `go install`. Renamed the module and all imports to `github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch` (user-selected option). The binary is still called `tpatch` because Go names installed binaries after the final path segment (`cmd/tpatch`).
2. **CI workflow added** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push and PR to `main`. It sets up Go via `go-version-file: go.mod` (so CI tracks local dev), checks formatting with `gofmt`, runs `go vet`, builds, tests, and runs an install smoke test. Matrix on `ubuntu-latest` + `macos-latest`. Concurrency group cancels superseded runs to save minutes. Free for public repos.
3. **README install block updated** — now points to the correct module path.

## Files Changed
- `go.mod` — `module github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch`.
- All `.go` files under `cmd/`, `internal/`, `assets/` — import paths rewritten.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — new CI workflow.
- `README.md` — install instructions updated.

## Test Results
- `gofmt -l .` — clean
- `go test ./... -count=1` — **ALL PASS** across 7 packages
- `go build -o tpatch ./cmd/tpatch` — OK
- `./tpatch --version` → `tpatch 0.3.0-dev`

## Post-Merge Checklist (for the repo owner)
1. Make the repo public (required for `go install` without auth and for free unlimited Actions minutes).
2. Push to `main`; CI should pass on both ubuntu + macOS.
3. Tag a release: `git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`. `go install ...@latest` will then resolve to that tag.
4. Verify from a clean machine: `go install github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/cmd/tpatch@latest`.

## Provider Preset Clarification
`tpatch provider set --preset copilot` targets `http://localhost:4141` with `auth_env: GITHUB_TOKEN`. That is the **copilot-api proxy** endpoint, not the Copilot CLI auth itself. To use the same Copilot subscription as `copilot-cli`:

- Install and run `copilot-api` locally (it does the GitHub OAuth and exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint on 4141).
- Then `tpatch provider set --preset copilot` just works.

There is no direct-to-GitHub-Copilot path today because GitHub has not published a public OpenAI-compatible Copilot endpoint. If that changes, we add another preset.

## Blockers
None.

## Next Steps
1. Push + make repo public + tag v0.3.0.
2. Confirm CI green on first main push.
3. Optional: add a `release.yml` workflow with goreleaser for prebuilt binaries (not required for `go install`).

## 2026-04-17 — Phase 2 Refinement: SDK Evaluation + Harness Guides + Tracking Cadence (v0.3.0-dev)

**Task**: Evaluate mainstream Go SDKs and agent CLIs; adopt simplest integration; tighten tracking cadence
**Agent**: Phase 2 refinement agent
**Verdict**: SUPERSEDED by 2026-04-17 distribution setup entry (see LOG.md)

## Session Summary

Iterated on the Phase 2 M7–M9 output after the user asked us to survey reference implementations and not waste resources on unneeded SDKs.

1. **SDK evaluation (ADR-003)** — Surveyed `OpenRouterTeam/go-sdk` (Speakeasy-generated, README marks non-production), `openai/openai-go`, `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go`. Decided to keep stdlib providers because: (a) our surface is `Check` + `Generate` only, (b) OpenRouter is drop-in OpenAI-compatible, (c) SDKs would add ~20 transitive deps for zero new capability. Positioned `openai/codex` and `github/copilot-cli` as *harnesses* (callers of tpatch), not providers.
2. **Presets for API parity** — Added `tpatch provider set --preset copilot|openai|openrouter|anthropic|ollama` backed by a single `providerPresets` map. Refactored `autoDetectProvider` to reuse the same map so there is one source of truth. Preset composes with explicit flag overrides (e.g. `--preset anthropic --model claude-opus-4`). Invalid presets fail loudly.
3. **Harness integration guides** — Wrote `docs/harnesses/codex.md` and `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` explaining the `tpatch next --format harness-json` contract, example sessions, recommended allow-lists, and anti-patterns (do not let the harness re-implement workflow phases).
4. **Tracking cadence** — Rewrote "Context Preservation Rules" in `AGENTS.md` with an enforced cadence cheatsheet (trigger → update). Updated `CLAUDE.md` Working Rules to reference the cadence. Key directive: "A task is not complete until tracking reflects its state."

## Files Created
- `docs/adrs/ADR-003-sdk-evaluation.md` — SDK evaluation decision, matrix, rationale.
- `docs/harnesses/codex.md` — Codex CLI integration guide.
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` — GitHub Copilot CLI integration guide.

## Files Changed
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — `providerPresets` map; `--preset` flag on `provider set`; auto-detect refactored to reuse presets.
- `internal/cli/phase2_test.go` — New `TestProviderSetPreset` covering openrouter/anthropic/unknown.
- `AGENTS.md` — Stronger "Context Preservation Rules" with cadence cheatsheet.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Working Rules point to cadence; explicit per-phase tracking requirement.

## Test Results
- `go test ./...` — **ALL PASS** (7 packages)
- `gofmt -l .` — **CLEAN**
- `go build -o tpatch ./cmd/tpatch` — **OK** (v0.3.0-dev)
- Manual verification:
  ```
  tpatch provider set --preset openrouter
  → type: openai-compatible, url: https://openrouter.ai/api, auth_env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  ```

## Key Decisions Locked In
- **No third-party provider SDKs.** Stdlib stays the provider layer.
- **`providerPresets` is the single source of truth.** Adding a new vendor = one map entry.
- **Harnesses (codex, copilot) call tpatch via CLI + JSON.** No SDK embed on either side.
- **Tracking updates are enforced per phase, not per session.**

## Blockers
None.

## Next Steps
1. Live smoke test with `codex exec` and `copilot` once an environment with both installed is available — confirm the handshake matches the guide.
2. Consider M10 (`tpatch mcp serve`) to expose the same state machine via MCP for Copilot CLI. Tracked as a follow-up only; not in the current ADR scope.
3. Supervisor review + roadmap update for this refinement pass.

## Context for Next Agent
- The preset map lives in `internal/cli/cobra.go` just below `providerSetCmd()`. Keep `--preset` and `autoDetectProvider` using the same map.
- Harness guides assume a repo-level `AGENTS.md` for codex and a `.github/copilot/cli/skills/tessera-patch/SKILL.md` for copilot-cli. Both are created by copying from the `.tpatch/steering/` outputs of `tpatch init`.
- ADR-003 explicitly lists the triggers that would cause us to reconsider adopting SDKs (streaming, non-standard schemas, official harness client libraries).
- Prior Phase 2 handoff (M7/M8/M9 initial) has been archived to `docs/handoff/HISTORY.md` under a 2026-04-17 entry.

## 2026-04-17 — M7 + M8 + M9 Phase 2 Implementation (v0.3.0-dev)

**Task**: Ship Phase 2 milestones (provider integration, LLM validation+retry, interactive/harness commands)
**Agent**: Phase 2 implementation agent
**Verdict**: APPROVED WITH NOTES (subsumed by 2026-04-17 refinement — see CURRENT.md)

## Session Summary

Implemented M7–M9 end-to-end:

1. **M7** — Added `AnthropicProvider` (`internal/provider/anthropic.go`) speaking the Messages API. Introduced `provider.NewFromConfig()` factory selecting by `cfg.Type`. Extended auto-detection to probe Ollama (localhost:11434), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Added `provider set --type` flag and `provider.type` validation. Wrote `docs/adrs/ADR-002-provider-strategy.md` documenting the decision and live-probe evidence for copilot-api; Ollama/OpenRouter confirmed compatible via existing OpenAI-compat provider (no code changes required).
2. **M8** — Added `GenerateWithRetry` in `internal/workflow/retry.go` with pluggable validators. `JSONObjectValidator` strips fences and round-trips the payload; `NonEmptyValidator` guards define/explore. Each attempt logs to `artifacts/raw-<phase>-response-N.txt`. Retries reissue the prompt with a corrective suffix describing the validator error. `max_retries` added to `config.yaml` (default 2), `--no-retry` flag added to analyze/define/explore/implement, context-keyed via `workflow.WithDisableRetry` to avoid signature churn.
3. **M9** — Shipped three new commands: `cycle` (batch and `--interactive` with `--editor` and `--skip-execute` options), `test` (runs `config.test_command`, records outcome in `apply-session.json` + `artifacts/test-output.txt`), `next` (emits next action as plain text or `--format harness-json`). Registered in root, version bumped to `0.3.0-dev`. All 6 skill formats updated to include `cycle`/`test`/`next`. Parity guard extended.

## Files Created
- `internal/provider/anthropic.go` — Anthropic Messages provider + `NewFromConfig` factory
- `internal/provider/anthropic_test.go` — Anthropic + factory tests
- `internal/workflow/retry.go` — `GenerateWithRetry`, validators, context flag
- `internal/workflow/retry_test.go` — retry-path tests
- `internal/cli/phase2.go` — `cycle`, `test`, `next` commands
- `internal/cli/phase2_test.go` — integration tests for the new commands
- `docs/adrs/ADR-002-provider-strategy.md` — provider strategy decision

## Files Changed
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — factory wiring, `--type` flag, `--no-retry` on 4 workflow commands, auto-detect extensions, config `max_retries`/`test_command` keys, version bump
- `internal/store/types.go` — `Config` gains `MaxRetries` and `TestCommand`
- `internal/store/store.go` — default config.yaml template + `SaveConfig` + `parseYAMLConfig` cover the new fields
- `internal/workflow/workflow.go` — analyze/define/explore call `GenerateWithRetry`
- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — implement calls `GenerateWithRetry`
- `assets/skills/*` + `assets/workflows/*` + `assets/prompts/*` — all 6 formats list the three new commands
- `assets/assets_test.go` — parity guard requires `cycle`, `test`, `next`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — M7/M8/M9 marked complete

## Test Results
- `go test ./...` — **ALL PASS** across 7 packages
- `gofmt -l .` — **CLEAN**
- `go build -o tpatch ./cmd/tpatch` — **OK** (v0.3.0-dev)
- Smoke test: `init` → `add` → `next --format harness-json` → `cycle --skip-execute` → `config set test_command echo hi` → `test` — all succeed end-to-end

## Noteworthy Details
- `Provider` interface unchanged (still `Check` + `Generate`). Adding providers is purely additive.
- Retry is disabled when no provider is configured (existing heuristic fallback untouched).
- `tpatch next` is state-aware: for `defined` features it further distinguishes "needs explore", "needs implement", or "needs apply" by probing the feature directory.
- `--no-retry` plumbing uses `context.WithValue` to avoid changing every workflow signature.
- Auto-detection order: copilot-api → Ollama → Anthropic (via env) → OpenAI (via env) → OpenRouter (via env).

## Blockers
None.

## Next Steps
1. Run live bug bash against copilot-api with retry enabled (ideally against a degraded-model path to exercise the corrective prompt).
2. Consider streaming/tool-use support as an optional capability interface when a future milestone needs it.
3. Consider harness integration guides (M9.10, M9.11) — deferred; the skill files and `tpatch next --format harness-json` already provide the contract.

## 2026-04-16 — M6 Live Provider Bug Bash (v0.2.0-dev, Session 4)

**Task**: Run bug bash with live copilot-api provider, add patch validation and merge strategy config  
**Agent**: Supervisor agent  
**Status**: Complete — Full pass with live LLM

**What was done**:
- Added `ValidatePatch()` to gitutil — automated patch validation on `record`
- Added `merge_strategy` config option (`3way` default, `rebase` alt) to types, store, and CLI
- Added `extractUpstreamContext()` to reconcile — reads affected files for Phase 3 prompt
- Ran complete bug bash with live copilot-api (claude-sonnet-4, 44 models)
- Live LLM analysis produced detailed, accurate results with correct file paths
- Feature A: `upstream_merged` via Phase 3 (LLM analyzed upstream model-mapping.ts)
- Feature B: `reapplied` via Phase 4 (LLM said still_needed, patch applied cleanly)

**Key finding**: Upstream context is critical for Phase 3. Without actual file contents, the LLM returns "unclear".

---

## 2026-04-16 — M6 Bug Bash + Bug Fixes (v0.2.0-dev)

**Task**: Run reconciliation bug bash, fix discovered bugs, re-test  
**Agent**: Supervisor agent (3 sessions)  
**Status**: Complete — Full pass

**What was done**:
- Session 2: Ran initial bug bash against `tesseracode/copilot-api` at commit `0ea08feb`
  - Feature A (model translation fix): Correctly detected as `upstream_merged` via Phase 3
  - Feature B (models CLI subcommand): Blocked — 3 bugs found in patch capture and CLI
  - Found BUG-1 (flag ordering), BUG-2 (corrupt patches), BUG-3 (stale recording)
- Session 3: Fixed all 3 bugs + bonus improvement
  - Migrated CLI from stdlib `flag` to `cobra` (fixes interspersed flags)
  - Rewrote `CapturePatch()` with `git add --intent-to-add` (fixes new file handling)
  - Added trailing newline to all patch output (fixes corrupt patch at EOF)
  - Added `--from` flag to `record` (captures committed diffs)
  - Added 3-way merge fallback to forward-apply (handles lockfile mismatches)
- Re-ran bug bash: Feature A → `upstream_merged`, Feature B → `reapplied`. Full pass.

**Key decisions**:
- Added cobra dependency (breaks zero-dep constraint, user-approved)
- Patches now always end with `\n`
- Forward-apply tries strict then 3-way merge fallback

## 2026-04-16 — M0–M5 Implementation (v0.1.0-dev)

**Task**: Build unified tpatch CLI from M0 through M5  
**Agent**: Supervisor agent (1 session)  
**Status**: Complete — All milestones approved

**What was done**:
- Built entire CLI in Go: 12 commands, ~2600 LOC source, ~850 LOC tests
- M0: Go module, CLI skeleton, Makefile
- M1: .tpatch/ data model, store layer, init/add/status/config, slug generation, path safety
- M2: OpenAI-compatible provider, analyze/define/explore with heuristic fallback
- M3: implement, apply (prepare/started/done), record, patch capture
- M4: 4-phase reconciliation engine with 4 test scenarios
- M5: 6 skill formats embedded via go:embed, parity guard test

---

## 2026-04-16 — Project Bootstrap (Governance)

**Task**: Bootstrap tpatch/ consolidation project with governance files  
**Agent**: Board review agent  
**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:
- Created SPEC.md consolidating technical decisions from all three teams
- Created CLAUDE.md for agent orientation with read-this-first table
- Created AGENTS.md defining the cyclic supervisor workflow (implementation → review → decision)
- Created ROADMAP.md with M0-M6 milestones + future M7-M11
- Created 7 milestone files with detailed task lists, acceptance criteria, and reference pointers
- Created handoff and supervisor log templates
- Created consolidation prompt for the supervisor agent

**Key decisions**:
- Go with zero dependencies (stdlib only)
- 4-phase reconciliation (reverse-apply → operation-level → provider-assisted → forward-apply)
- 6 skill formats (Claude, Copilot, Copilot Prompt, Cursor, Windsurf, Generic)
- Deterministic apply recipe with path traversal protection
- Secret-by-reference pattern for provider credentials
# Current Handoff

## Active Task
- **Task ID**: ADR-004 (M10 proxy UX) + ADR-005 (M11 native provider)
- **Milestone**: Planning locked-in for M10 and M11
- **Description**: User chose interactively through open questions; decisions captured as two ADRs. PRD updated to match the session-token-exchange direction (copilot-api/litellm pattern) instead of opencode's simpler path.
- **Status**: ADRs written, awaiting supervisor review
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-17

## Session Summary

1. **Committed Phase 2 work** as commit `dc42718` ("Phase 2 (v0.3.0): providers, validation, interactive/harness, distribution"). Includes all M7/M8/M9, refinement, and distribution changes.
2. **Released v0.3.0** — bumped version constant from `0.3.0-dev` to `0.3.0`, committed as `305781d`, tagged `v0.3.0` with a full release note. Tag is local; repo owner still needs to `git push origin main --tags`.
3. **Researched Copilot auth options**:
   - Pulled `tesseracode/copilot-api` README — explicitly "reverse-engineered proxy… not supported by GitHub… may trigger abuse-detection systems."
   - Pulled `github/copilot-cli` README and repo root listing — **not open source** (only README, install.sh, changelog, LICENSE published; the CLI is a closed-source binary on Homebrew/npm/WinGet). Official auth paths: `/login` OAuth or `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` with "Copilot Requests" PAT permission.
   - Conclusion: **GitHub does not publish a public OpenAI-compatible Copilot endpoint.** Every third-party integration (copilot-api, Claude Code via proxy, tpatch) is on reverse-engineered surface.
4. **Wrote PRD** (`docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`) with 5 options evaluated and a two-phase recommendation: M10 managed-proxy UX (`copilot-start` / `copilot-stop` / `copilot-status`), then M11 opt-in native PAT provider calling `api.githubcopilot.com` directly. Shelling out to `copilot` CLI explicitly rejected (burns premium requests, re-runs its own agent loop).

## Files Created
- `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`

## Files Changed
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — version `0.3.0-dev` → `0.3.0` (committed)

## Git State
- `dc42718` — Phase 2 feature commit
- `305781d` — "Release v0.3.0" (version bump)
- `v0.3.0` — tag on 305781d
- **Not yet pushed.** Repo owner needs `git push origin main && git push origin v0.3.0`.

## Test Results
- `gofmt -l .` clean
- `go test ./...` — all 7 packages pass
- `tpatch --version` → `tpatch 0.3.0`

## Key Decisions (captured in ADR-004 and ADR-005)

**M10 — copilot-api UX (ADR-004)**
- No process supervision; we warn when unreachable, point at install instructions.
- Upstream `ericc-ch/copilot-api` is the recommended proxy; internal TODO to revisit the tesseracode fork if its fixes become blocking.
- New global config at `~/.config/tpatch/config.yaml`; per-repo `.tpatch/config.yaml` overrides.
- Reachability probe on first call (`GET /v1/models`, 2s timeout); warn-but-continue on `init`, hard-fail on workflow commands.
- First-run AUP warning stored in global config; no log piping; Windows deferred.

**M11 — native Copilot provider (ADR-005)**
- **Changed direction**: port ericc-ch/copilot-api's internal flow (session-token exchange via `copilot_internal/v2/token` + VS Code Copilot Chat client ID `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`) rather than opencode's simpler Bearer-the-OAuth-token path. copilot-api and litellm both use this flow → proven, field-exposed surface that matches what Copilot's own editor plugins do.
- Token storage: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tpatch/copilot-auth.json`, chmod 0600. OS keychain deferred.
- OAuth token treated as long-lived; 401 triggers one retry then "run copilot-login again".
- Device-flow prompts for GitHub.com vs Enterprise; Enterprise domain captured at login.
- `GET /models` every session, no persistent cache.
- Editor headers overridable via `provider.headers_override`; `x-initiator` opt-in, unset by default.
- `type: copilot-native` distinct from `type: openai-compatible` + copilot proxy.
- Opt-in gate with AUP acknowledgement in global config.

## Blockers
- None for the PRD itself.
- M11 (native provider) is soft-blocked on the "can we ship the editor header set?" legal question noted in the PRD.

## Next Steps
1. **Repo owner**: decide whether to create a GitHub Release for v0.3.0 (or add `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` to CI for automation on future tags).
2. **Before M11 implementation begins**: answer the two open questions in the PRD and ADR-005 (legal/ToS on editor headers; GitHub roadmap for an official endpoint).
3. **Next agent session — M10 implementation** per ADR-004: add global-config loader, reachability probe in provider-set/init flow, first-run AUP warning helper.
4. **After M10 lands — M11 implementation** per ADR-005, gated on the open questions.

## Context for Next Agent
- PRD lives at `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`. It includes the full options matrix and the rejection rationale for each alternative.
- The `Provider` interface is stable and Phase 1 does not need to touch it at all — the managed proxy still routes through the existing `OpenAICompatible` code path. Phase 2 adds a sibling struct.
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` already documents the current manual setup; update it when M10 lands.
- GitHub has explicitly warned users in copilot-api's README about abuse-detection. Our UX for M10/M11 must surface that warning prominently.

# Current Handoff

## Active Task
- **Task ID**: M10 — Managed Copilot proxy UX (ADR-004)
- **Milestone**: M10 delivered
- **Description**: Honest UX for the reverse-engineered `copilot-api` proxy — global config, reachability probe, first-run AUP warning, install pointers, CI release automation.
- **Status**: Implemented; awaiting supervisor review.
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-17

## Session Summary

1. **CI release automation** — added a `release` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that triggers on `v*` tag pushes, creates a GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`, auto-generates release notes, and marks tags containing `-` as prereleases. Uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`. Cost: free.
2. **Global config** — new `internal/store/global.go` adds `GlobalConfigPath()`, `LoadGlobalConfig`, `SaveGlobalConfig`, `(s *Store).LoadMergedConfig`, `AcknowledgeCopilotAUP`, `CopilotAUPAcknowledged`, `mergeConfig`, `renderGlobalYAML`. Honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, falls back to `os.UserConfigDir()` (macOS caveat documented in the harness doc). Chmod 0600 on write.
3. **Config precedence** — repo `.tpatch/config.yaml` overrides the global config field-by-field; zero values do **not** clear globals (must set the field explicitly). AUP ack is global-only.
4. **Types** — `Config.CopilotAUPAckAt string` added to `internal/store/types.go`.
5. **Reachability probe** — new `internal/provider/probe.go` with `Reachable(ctx, cfg)` (2s timeout), `IsLocalEndpoint(cfg)`, `IsCopilotProxyEndpoint(cfg)` helpers. Probes via existing `Check()`.
6. **CLI wiring** — new `internal/cli/copilot.go` with `copilotInstallHint`, `copilotAUPWarning`, `maybeShowAUPWarning`, `ensureProviderReachable`, `warnIfUnreachable`, `providerConfigFromStore`. Wired into `init` (warn-continue + AUP) and `providerSetCmd` + `autoDetectProvider` (AUP on first Copilot selection).
7. **Workflow hard-fail** — `loadAndProbeProvider(ctx, s)` replaces `loadProviderFromStore` in analyze/define/explore/implement/cycle. Probes once per process (cached per base URL). Local-endpoint-only; opt-out via `TPATCH_NO_PROBE=1`. Non-local endpoints skip the probe to avoid penalising custom remote configs.
8. **Execute now surfaces errors** — `Execute()` prints `error: %v` to stderr before returning exit code 1 so probe failures are visible. Preserves existing `SilenceErrors: true` cobra behaviour for graceful formatting.
9. **Harness doc refresh** — `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` now documents the install path, OS-dependent global config path (macOS caveat), warn-vs-fail behaviour, and links to ADR-004/005.
10. **Tests** — 6 new tests in `internal/store/global_test.go` (roundtrip, missing file, ack idempotency, precedence, merge-no-clear, save creates dir) and 5 in `internal/provider/probe_test.go` (httptest OK, TEST-NET-1 timeout, not-configured, URL matcher, cancelled ctx). All 7 packages pass.

## Files Created
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — amended (release job)
- `internal/store/global.go`
- `internal/store/global_test.go`
- `internal/provider/probe.go`
- `internal/provider/probe_test.go`
- `internal/cli/copilot.go`

## Files Changed
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — `loadAndProbeProvider`, `Execute` prints errors, AUP wiring in `init` / `providerSetCmd` / `autoDetectProvider`, `sync` import.
- `internal/store/types.go` — `CopilotAUPAckAt` field.
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` — M10 section.

## Test Results
- `gofmt -w .` clean
- `go vet ./...` clean
- `go test ./... -count=1` — 7/7 packages pass
- `go build ./cmd/tpatch` OK
- Smoke: `init` + `provider set --preset copilot` prints AUP warning exactly once; second run is quiet; `analyze` against a dead localhost port hard-fails with an install hint; against a live copilot-api proxy falls through to the workflow.

## Key Behaviours

- **Warn vs fail**: `init` and `provider set` are warn-continue (a user may be bootstrapping before starting the proxy). Workflow commands that actually call the LLM (`analyze|define|explore|implement|cycle`) hard-fail when the local endpoint is unreachable.
- **Probe scope**: only runs for local endpoints (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). Remote endpoints are trusted.
- **AUP once**: the AUP warning fires only when the new config actually points at the copilot-api proxy (`openai-compatible` + port 4141) and the user has not acknowledged before.
- **TODO**: `copilotInstallHint` carries an inline `TODO(adr-004)` comment to revisit the tesseracode fork recommendation if its divergent fixes become blocking.

## Blockers
- None for M10.
- M11 still soft-blocked on the two open questions in ADR-005 (editor-headers legal/ToS, official endpoint roadmap). User direction: proceed with editor headers, monitor; so these are effectively closed as "accept risk".

## Next Steps
1. Supervisor review of M10 implementation.
2. Commit as `feat(m10): managed copilot-api proxy UX (ADR-004)` and push.
3. Consider tagging `v0.3.1` once review lands — CI will produce the GitHub Release automatically.
4. Start M11 implementation per ADR-005 (native Copilot provider with session-token exchange) once M10 is merged.

## Context for Next Agent
- Global config on macOS defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/tpatch/config.yaml` unless `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set. Every test that touches global state sets `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to a tempdir; follow this pattern.
- `TPATCH_NO_PROBE=1` disables the workflow hard-fail probe (useful for offline demos or CI steps that only read store state). Add it to future tests that should not hit the network.
- The probe cache is a process-level `map[string]error` guarded by a mutex — fine for the CLI's one-shot lifecycle but intentionally not time-bound, so long-running processes would need to invalidate it. Not a concern today.
- `Execute()` now prints errors. Tests that exercise `rootCmd.Execute()` directly still use the cobra `SetErr` buffer; only the top-level wrapper prints to stderr.
- The AUP warning text lives in `internal/cli/copilot.go::copilotAUPWarning`. Tweak there, not in harness docs.
# Current Handoff

## Active Task
- **Task ID**: v0.4.2 / A1 — `bug-implement-silent-fallback`
- **Milestone**: Tranche A "Truthful Errors" (post-stress-test, plan.md)
- **Description**: Surface the implement-phase fallback to the user, raise
  the LLM token budget so legitimate recipes are not truncated, and let
  the user override the budget via config.
- **Status**: A1 complete; A2 (`bug-cycle-state-mismatch`) is now active.
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-18

## Session Summary

A1 landed in this session:

1. **Config knob** — `Config.MaxTokensImplement` (`internal/store/types.go`),
   default `DefaultMaxTokensImplement = 16384`. Repo override via
   `max_tokens_implement:` in `.tpatch/config.yaml`; global override via
   the same key in `~/.config/tpatch/config.yaml`. `parseYAMLConfig` reads
   it; `SaveConfig` and `renderGlobalYAML` emit it; `mergeConfigs` lets
   the repo value win when set.
2. **Implement fallback no longer silent** — `internal/workflow/implement.go`
   gained a package-level `WarnWriter io.Writer = os.Stderr`. When
   `GenerateWithRetry` exhausts its retry budget the fallback writes a
   warning to `WarnWriter` naming the retry count, the underlying error,
   the path to `raw-implement-response-*.txt`, and the config knob to
   bump on retry.
3. **MaxTokens bump** — implement phase now requests
   `cfg.MaxTokensImplement` (defaulting to 16384) instead of the
   hard-coded 8192. Other phases unchanged for now (analyze/define/explore
   stay at 4096; revisit if real failures surface).
4. **Tests** — `internal/workflow/implement_test.go`:
   - `TestRunImplement_FallbackEmitsWarning` drives `RunImplement` with
     a fake provider that returns un-parseable JSON, captures
     `WarnWriter`, asserts the warning text, and confirms the heuristic
     recipe is the one written to disk.
   - `TestConfig_DefaultMaxTokensImplement` confirms a freshly-`Init`-ed
     repo loads the 16384 default.

## Current State

- Repo at clean working tree on top of v0.4.1 (no commits yet for v0.4.2;
  Tranche A will be tagged together once A1–A10 land).
- `gofmt -l .` clean, `go build ./cmd/tpatch` ok, `go test ./...` green.
- Plan lives at
  `~/.copilot/session-state/f2c5d9eb-cef9-41dc-aab7-ad825ffca018/plan.md`.

## Files Changed (A1)

- `internal/store/types.go` — added `MaxTokensImplement` field +
  `DefaultMaxTokensImplement` const.
- `internal/store/store.go` — parser entry, repo template, `SaveConfig`
  renderer.
- `internal/store/global.go` — merge precedence + `renderGlobalYAML`.
- `internal/workflow/implement.go` — `WarnWriter`, dynamic `MaxTokens`,
  surfaced fallback warning.
- `internal/workflow/implement_test.go` — new test file.

## Test Results

```
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/assets
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/cli
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/provider
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/safety
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/store
ok  github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/workflow
```

## Next Steps

Continue Tranche A in order. The full ordered list is in plan.md; the
next 4 tasks are:

1. **A2 `bug-cycle-state-mismatch`** — audit `cycle` state transitions,
   ensure `state` advances even on heuristic fallback, add per-phase
   post-condition assertions, add a `cycle --skip-execute` test that
   reaches `implemented`. Currently `in_progress` in SQL.
2. **A3 `bug-record-validation-false-positive`** — switch record-time
   validation to `git apply --reverse --check` (add
   `gitutil.ValidatePatchReverse`).
3. **A4 `bug-reconcile-phase4-false-positive`** — three-state verdict
   (`reapplied-strict` / `reapplied-with-3way` / `blocked`); detect
   conflict markers via temp worktree apply.
4. **A5 `bug-skill-invocation-clarity`** — Invocation + Phase-ordering +
   Preflight blocks across all 6 skill formats; parity guard updated.

Then A6–A10, version bump to 0.4.2, CHANGELOG, tag.

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Agent

- Use `WarnWriter` (not `fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, ...)` directly) for any
  new non-fatal phase warnings; tests rely on being able to swap it.
- The implement phase is the only phase that needs the larger token
  budget right now. If you change another phase's budget, mirror the
  pattern (config knob + `Default*` const + global+repo merge).
- The Tranche-A version bump happens **once** at the end of A10. Do NOT
  bump `cobra.go:version` or write a CHANGELOG entry as you go — group
  them in a single v0.4.2 commit.
- The session SQL is the source of truth for task progress
  (`SELECT id, status FROM todos WHERE status='pending' ORDER BY id`).
- Co-author trailer required on every commit:
  `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`.
